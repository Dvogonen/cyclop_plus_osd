#Build CYCLOP++
- The project is built using the Arduino development environment. Download the Arduino development environment from www.arduino.cc.
- Install the development environment.
- Download the CYCLOP++ source code from GitHub.
- Navigate to the cyclop_plus_plus.ino file and open it in the Arduino development environment.
- Specify "Arduino Pro or Pro Mini" as board. Then select "Atmega 328 (3.3 volt, 8 MHz)" as processor. These settings are found in the "Tool" menu.
- Build the project by pressing the v icon in the upper left corner of the Arduino window.

#Build MinimOSD For CYCLOPS
- The project is built using the same Arduino development environment as used for CYCLOP++.
- The source code is included in the CYCLOP++ source code you downloaded earlier from GitHub.
- Navigate to the minimosd_for_cyclop.ino file and open it in the Arduino development environment.
- Specify "Arduino Pro or Pro Mini" as board. Then select "Atmega 328 (5 volt, 16 MHz)" as processor. These settings are found in the "Tool" menu.
- Build the project by pressing the v icon in the upper left corner of the Arduino window.
